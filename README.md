> <|title|>I have a feeling good about us and what we can achieve together.   There is no choice in this --  we need to be in it together and together.  We have the means and we are going to make this country great again.  Donald J. Trump<|endoftext|>

> <|title|>I don't think it will happen to me until very recently. What I don't think is a question. I think if I am nominated, America will have faith in somebody who is going to bring it together so we can make America great again!<|endoftext|>

> <|title|>I called at 9pm on Friday morning to discuss why I plan to run. It was tough speaking to the media, in the press room, and in the gym. -DJT<|endoftext|>

> <|title|>It is with great sadness that I have to announce that our Senate majority will NOT be needed to pass ObamaCare. The GOP tax plan is worse than ever before. I have known ObamaCare for many years, and you know it. I want to make sure my people will be covered. There is no question that we are going to build a great wall along our southern border to keep out illegal immigrants. This is imperative, and it is absolutely imperative that every American is covered and treated equally. My tax plan is an honest return to the values of our founders.  This plan includes giving millions of Americans free healthcare as guaranteed to all Americans for the full 15 years of their existence. I promise you that our people will be treated equally.  ObamaCare also keeps our country safe and secure, and is responsible for keeping jobs in our country. So strong is my commitment to making sure every American receives a great health care plan, and to allowing everyone a choice of coverage at no extra cost to them, under this new plan. WE will make America strong again. I know that this is your last chance to do the right thing for your family, your communities, and the American people – and in 2016 you won't forget it. Thank you for your support. My Heritage. $450 million in new funding will go toward signing up every American who needs insurance. Everyone must have health insurance. We cannot let this happen.  As Governor I will work to create economic opportunity for our nation. But my plan will allow middle-class Americans to keep their health insurance and lower premiums – and that means seniors and parents will have access to great health care. My health care will empower millions of families, especially young and healthy, to access quality health care. Together, our nation will have a truly great country – and the health insurance that everyone needs.#GOPDebate #Trump2016 I will do everything I can to ensure that you all have access to coverage for your health plan – not just the Obamacare plan. You will still have the same access to coverage, which makes it far more affordable for everyone. If you are under 26 years old, your first year of eligibility for coverage should go straight to the company that has your premium as an immigrant or a disabled parent, instead of relying on individual health plans or a state-run exchange.
